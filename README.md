##  Features

|    | Feature            | Description                                                                                             |
|----|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️  | **Architecture**   | The project uses TypeScript for defining types across various functionalities like API, proxy, and rate. It employs modular design principles, facilitating scalable and maintainable code structure. |
| 🔩 | **Code Quality**   | Adheres to strict linting and formatting rules enforced by ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript-specific plugins to maintain high code quality and style consistency. |
| 📄 | **Documentation**  | Limited to descriptive comments within code files; lacks comprehensive external documentation, impacting clarity on usage and integration. |
| 🔌 | **Integrations**   | Primarily focused on types definitions with implicit potential for integration in projects dealing with APIs, proxies, or rate management systems. |
| 🧩 | **Modularity**     | Highly modular, organizing code into namespaces and modules for shared, rate, API, and proxy functionalities, which enhances reusability and maintainability. |
| 🧪 | **Testing**        | No explicit mention of testing frameworks or tools in the provided details, indicating a potential area for improvement in the project. |
| ⚡️  | **Performance**    | Performance impact is minimal as it serves as a types library. Its efficiency lies in aiding development speed and code integrity rather than runtime performance. |
| 🛡️ | **Security**       | Direct security measures aren't applicable as it's a types definitions package, but adherence to code quality standards indirectly contributes to safer integrations. |
| 📦 | **Dependencies**   | Relies on a suite of ESLint plugins, TypeScript, JSON, and GitHub Actions for linting, formatting, and CI/CD, ensuring a robust development environment. |
| 🚀 | **Scalability**    | The project's modular architecture and focused scope allow for easy scalability within its domain of types definitions for TypeScript-based projects. |
